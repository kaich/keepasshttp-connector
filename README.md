# FantasyKee

is an extension to integrate [KeePass](http://keepass.info)/[KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) as a password manager with Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome browsers.

They require [KeePassHttp](https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp/), a KeePass plugin to expose password entries securely (256bit AES/CBC) over HTTP.

It was forked from [chromeIPass/passIFox](https://github.com/pfn/passifox), with support for newer versions of Firefox (42+).

## Deprecation Notice

This extension will no longer be maintained since KeePassXC 2.3.0 now includes support for the [keepassxc-browser](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc-browser) extension, and will be removing KeePassHTTP support in a future release.

For KeePass, you can use my [KeePassNatMsg](https://github.com/smorks/keepassnatmsg) plugin, which also works with the keepassxc-browser extension.
